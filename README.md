## How To Run

#### Clone the app

```
git clone https://github.com/danBamikiya/movie-finder.git
```

#### Navigate to the cloned directory

```
cd movie-finder
```

#### Install dependencies

```
npm i
```

#### Add personal RapidAPI token (free)
We recommend setting this up when running the project locally, as we use the RapidAPI to fetch movies data.
>   -  [Sign up](https://rapidapi.com/signup) to create a RapidAPI account and [follow these steps](https://docs.rapidapi.com/docs/keys) to get a RapidAPI token
>   -  In local repo root directory: Make a copy of `.env.example` and name it `.env`
>   -  Copy & paste your new RapidAPI token into .env
```
// .env Example (an invalid key):
RAPID_API_KEY=K6NUTARFJZJCIXHF1F1E1YGJZ8RQ29BE4U
```

#### Quick Start

- To run the development server:

```
npm run start
```

- To build the app:

```
npm run build
```

- To build and serve the production build locally:

```
npm run build:serve-local
```
